# PacMen
An unlimited number of animated PacMen chase each other around the window.<br>Uses the DOM and arrays to iterate through all objects created by the user, updating positions and reversing the direction and animation when each image is about to exceed the space of the window.

# How to run
Click the "Add PacMan" button to add an image to the DOM with randomized speed and position variables. 
Click "Start Game" to begin the animation. You may add more PacMan images at any time by pressing "Add PacMan" again.

# Roadmap of Future Improvements
Update the HTML/CSS to allow embed of this game into a more dynamic web page
